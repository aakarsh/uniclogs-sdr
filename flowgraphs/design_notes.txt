Flowgraph external control

*  Rx Doppler frequency offset
   *  Pick up frequency offset from HamLib rigctld
   *  HamLib rigctld gets offset from GPredict or any similar SGP4 orbit prediction code
   *  Flowgraph picks up variable using XMLRPC server and places into variable doppler_offset
   *  Flowgraph already tested to use this variable correctly

*  Tx Transmit control
   *  Simple Tx On/Off switch
   *  Key up transmitter when outgoing "traffic" becomes available in the UPD socket according
      to the following flow.
     *  Key up transmitter
     *  Wait TxDelay (In a variable, ~30 ms) time
     *  Send traffic
     *  Wait TxTail (In a variable, ~10 ms) time
     *  Key down transmitter
